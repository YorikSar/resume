Common Summary
--------------

I am a Senior Software Engineer with 9+ years of professional background.
I worked with and contributed to many open source projects like OpenStack
(mostly Neutron and Octavia projects), Kubernetes and Tungsten Fabric.
I made many contributions to OpenStack, mainly in Python.
I was in the core review team for Neutron and I am still in the Octavia core
review team.
For the last 2 years I am mostly involved in development of Kubernetes
operators based on operator-sdk in Go.
Aside from working on these projects I was also involved in their integration
with Salt and Kubernetes based cloud platforms.

I am eager to learn new technologies and my motto in work is “Any task can be
done, for some it is just a matter of time and patience”.
