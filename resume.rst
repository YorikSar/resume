Common Summary
--------------

I am a Senior Software Engineer with a 9+ year of professional background.
I am Python developer, but last 2 years I mostly involved in Go development of Kubernetes operators
(operator-sdk based).
Work with open source projects, like OpenStack (mostly Neutron and Octavia projects).
I was part of the core review team for Neutron and I am still part of Octavia core review team.
Aside from working on these projects I was also involved in their integration into Salt based and
Kubernetes based cloud platforms.

Last two years I have worked with Tungsten Fabric (OpenContrail) and its integration with Mirantis
OpenStack Kubernetes Platform.

I am eager to learn new technologies and my motto in work “All tasks can be solved, for some it
is just a matter of time and patience”.
